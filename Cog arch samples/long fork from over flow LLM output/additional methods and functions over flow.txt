Here are additional methods and functions. The main idea is to create an agent that can adapt its behavior based on feedback and the current situation, reflect on its decisions, manage its resources, display its state (resources, goals, constraints, plan, emotions, memory, commands), and make decisions based on its perceptions, memories, and emotions. For simplicity, some of the methods have placeholder implementations that can be replaced with more complex logic based on the specific requirements of your cognitive model. Make sure to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.
