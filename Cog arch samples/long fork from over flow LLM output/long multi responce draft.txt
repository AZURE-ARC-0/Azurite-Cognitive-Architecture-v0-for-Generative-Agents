As you mentioned, each agent has a `MemorySystem`, `PerceptionSystem`, `EmotionalSystem`, `ReasoningSystem`, and `ResourceSystem` to mimic a cognitive model. I've added methods to each system to reflect the operations you mentioned. I've also added several methods to the `Agent` class to reflect the agent's interactions with the world, its goals and constraints, and its commands. Some of these methods are just placeholders for now, so you'll want to implement them according to your specific requirements. I hope this is helpful!
